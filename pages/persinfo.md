# **Personal Information**

Name: Michael Robertson | Student ID: s3817321 | Email: s3817321@student.rmit.edu.au
<p></p>
I was born and raised in Germany although my surname suggests otherwise. This is because I have inherited it from my Scottish ancestors. I speak German and English and I have an HSC equivalent education. I left Germany in 1998 when I moved to Scotland to work for IBM UK near Glasgow. Since then, a personal choice brought me to Australia and a professional one lead me to Switzerland, first to Geneva and then to Zurich. In my spare time I like to play PS4, spend time with our two kittens and watch football with my teenage son.
