# **Interest in IT**

I dabbled with computers ever since I was a child. It all started when I got my first Commodore VIC-20 back in the early 80â€™s. My first real PC was an Intel 80286. I chose IT as my profession soon after I left school and in the past 20+ years it has taken me to work in different cities around the world.

I am interested in almost any aspect of IT and whilst I have a lot of experience in many areas, I enjoy maintaining and fixing hardware and software systems hand-on. I also enjoy leading small teams and being the first point of contact for anything IT infrastructure related.

I am an IT Specialist with extensive experience in various other roles and sectors including e-commerce, retail, financial markets and the metal industry. I have been managing staff and providing support for hardware and software to different types of businesses, small to enterprise level over the years. I am currently working as an IT specialist and shift supervisor for German supermarket chain. Our office is running a national Helpdesk for all stores and regional head offices across Australia.


Why did I choose to come to RMIT?

RMIT was one of several universities offering courses when I enquired with Online Universities Australia. RMIT has a good reputation and I know many students who completed their studies on campus. I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT for that reason.

What do you expect to learn during your studies? 

My studies will give me the opportunity to discover areas that I have been exposed to but have not had the chance to fully experience. I hope I will be able to dive deeper into areas such as cloud computing and big data for example. I have mostly worked in service and helpdesk environments all through my career that is why I have a keen interest in service management and CRM tools. I wish to expand on these subjects during my studies.
