# **Ideal Job**

I am interested in positions within multi-national companies, managing and maintaining IT infrastructure and possibly
leading small teams of on-site support staff and engineers, supporting several sites nationally or internationally.

Below is a link to a job (found on seek.com.au):

#### **Divisional IT Manager**

This company is seeking a Divisional IT Manager, someone to lead a small support team looking after the operational and infrastructure side of the business. One of the key activities is to transform the company to be more responsive and customer focussed. The role is based in Melbourne, Australia, but their 300+ users are located throughout Australia and New Zealand at over 17 sites.

This job is very appealing to me as I am seeking a role that incorporates the management of a small team of support staff in an operations/infrastructure environment and at the same time is technical and possibly hands-on. I would also be able to collaborate with other teams throughout Asia Pacific to work on future projects and strategic goals.

The job advertisement does not contain the usual requirements and qualifications section. However, it speaks of key selection criteria (KSC). A role like this would require a qualification such as a Bachelor of Information Technology with at least 2+ years of experience in a similar role, the ability to lead a team, including training and mentoring and a high level of vendor management with a proven record of completing projects on time and within the budget. The KSC indicates they are looking for someone with previous experience working for a multi-national company who has strong analytical and problem-solving skills and can manage day to day business interacting with internal and external stakeholders. It also includes a proven record of delivering IT projects and the ability to get things done.

I have previously worked in a similar position as a Lead Engineer, providing technical support and looking after a clientâ€™s manufacturing and administration sites, including the on-site support staff. I was the Technical Lead who managed the on-site engineers at the various locations. I have thoroughly enjoyed this role and would like to find a similar role that offers more responsibility and challenges. This was a very technical role and did not include managerial responsibilities such as hiring and firing or budget planning. I have also managed a small team of application supporters and testers in Melbourne at an e-commerce company many years ago. I would say I have the experience in leading a technical support team, I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills and I have thorough experience in vendor management and dealing with internal and external stakeholders. I have been working on many projects but never lead one, so I cannot say I have a proven record of delivering projects. I have not looked after a budget as such but was using one to purchase equipment from hardware manufacturers and telecom companies. I was indirectly looking after it, planning not to go over the budget and postpone and move rollouts or hardware refreshes to next financial year if possible. I have always been hands-on and trained and mentored colleagues and staff when required.

In order to be considered and to be successful in such a role, I will have to firstly complete my studies to then have the relevant educational qualification and to further gain experience in areas such as project planning and delivering. I have many years of experience in managing vendors as well as managing and communicating with internal and external stakeholders.
I have also been working for multi-national companies, looking after multiple sites and support staff in more than one country. I will work on my current skills and I will try to be more involved in the planning of projects at my current job. In a few years, once I have completed my studies, I will then have a proven record of leading and completing projects. It will be hard to obtain further managerial experience in my current position. I will still be able to work on my ability to lead a team in my position as shift supervisor and to complete assigned tasks as part of a bigger project.
