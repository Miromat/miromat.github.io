The results of all three tests paint a similar picture. I am a person who stays calm and thinks clearly in stressful situations. I am slightly introverted and love helping others.
I prefer a combination of hands-on learning with the addition of visual and aural learning material. I agree with most of the test results. There are things I knew about myself and some that I did not. I find it very interesting that the Myers-Briggs test sees my personality type in supporting roles and helping others. I have been working in IT Support roles for most of my professional career, enjoying it immensely. The joy and satisfaction I get from helping others and solving their problems has now been explained to me.

I have never had issues in the past working in teams, it is the opposite, I actually enjoy it. Working with others is a great experience, especially when people come from different backgrounds and cultures. Different thinking and language barriers can be hard to overcome but, in the end, it benefits the project and will help the team to achieve extraordinary things. Looking at my results, I think they will positively influence my behaviour in working with a team. I like teamwork. I can apply my ideas and help finish tasks. There is no reason to adjust or change as teamwork comes to me naturally.

If required I could lead a project team but I would prefer to be an equally important member in a supporting role getting tasks done and offer technical knowledge and experience. This means when forming a team, I would ideally be looking to find a group with someone who has an interest in such a role and is happy is happy to take the lead.
I believe in my group there are such members who would be suitable through previous experiences and their current positions.
