# **Project Idea**

#### **BVB News Feeder**
A personalised news feeder

##### **Overview**

My project idea is a personalised news feeder/search engine. Something like a website or application that searches for any news concerning a particular topic or keywords during the night to then present a summary to the user in the morning. In my case, this is going be BVB Dortmund, a football club from the German Bundesliga, that my son and I are following. That is the reason why I have branded it BVB Dortmund News Feeder, to give it a name.
